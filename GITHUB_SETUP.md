# Step-by-Step: Create GitHub Repository

## Step 1: Go to GitHub

1. Open your browser and go to: **https://github.com**
2. Sign in (or create an account if you don't have one)

## Step 2: Create New Repository

1. Click the **"+"** icon in the top right corner of GitHub
2. Click **"New repository"**

## Step 3: Fill in Repository Details

Fill in these fields:

- **Repository name**: `curling` (or `iselin-curl-o-rama` - doesn't matter for the URL)
- **Description**: `Fantasy Olympic Curling League - Iselin Curl-O-Rama`
- **Visibility**: 
  - Choose **Public** (free, anyone can see the code)
  - OR **Private** (only you can see it - still works fine for deployment)
- **IMPORTANT**: 
  - ❌ **DO NOT** check "Add a README file"
  - ❌ **DO NOT** check "Add .gitignore" (we already have one)
  - ❌ **DO NOT** check "Choose a license"
  
  (We already have all these files!)

## Step 4: Create Repository

Click the green **"Create repository"** button at the bottom.

## Step 5: Copy Your Repository URL

After creating the repo, GitHub will show you a page with setup instructions.

**Copy the HTTPS URL** - it will look like:
`https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/curling.git`

(Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username)

**Once you have the repository URL, come back here and I'll help you push your code!**
